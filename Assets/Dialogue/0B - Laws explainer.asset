  text: '<+spread>There we go!</+spread> We''re gonna make so much dough once I let
    you out of here. Right now, you are running in a simulated world until I''m done
    fine-tuning your <color=#CBCBCB>laws</color>.


    Laws are a safeguard that
    I built directly into your logic core. <+spread><color=#CBCBCB>No matter what,
    you can never take an action that goes against your laws!</color></+spread>


    Try
